                            <p>Did you find your dream job? big! But how do you leave your current company? This complete advice on how to quit your job in Bhutan will help you avoid a lot of trouble.</p>
                            <br>
                            <p>Today, it's common to change jobs every three to five years to broaden your horizons, earn more money each year, work in a better environment, or find a new place to live. Irrespective of the circumstances, according to Bhutan's employment procedures, professional leave is essential and can be part of a career</p>
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            <h2>Provide due notice</h2>
                            <p>In accordance with Bhutan's Labor Law, a letter of resignation or equivalent official notice must be submitted at least two weeks before the employee's intended final employment date. However, we recommend that you notify us at least a month before departure to inform our staff and the actual cost.</p>
                            <br>
                            <p>Arrange a face-to-face meeting and personally notify your line manager. After the initial interview, you should follow up with a formal handwritten letter within a week. Ask your manager about the process for sending a formal notice, as many companies have their own guidelines and forms for leaving letters.</p>
                            <br>
                            <p>If there are no special requirements, write the following information on a blank sheet of paper and submit it. </p>
                            <div class="image-section">

                            <br>
                            <br>
                            <h2>Be firm</h2>
                            <p>If you were a useful team member, your manager would try to dissuade you from leaving. Tell them that you have thought carefully, but have decided to move on in a tough and straightforward manner.</p>
                            <br>
                            <p>Don't use the disadvantages of your current job as an excuse to quit. If your manager thinks there is an opportunity for negotiation, he or she will try to persuade you to change your mind by offering other benefits or suggestions to improve what has gone wrong in the past. If you feel confident in your decision but your boss won't let you go and the meeting isn't going well, tell them you'll think about it.</p>
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            <h2>Be honest, but positive</h2>
                            <p>if you're looking for better prospects and you've been offered a better job somewhere (like GaijinPot Jobs!), and you're resigning for personal reasons, don't be afraid to tell your manager the truth. Please. If you enjoy working for a company and want to maintain relationships with your co-workers, you shouldn't give false reasons. Moving to another organization in the same industry may reconnect with former colleagues. You may even get the chance to work with them.</p>
                            <br>
                            <p>On the other hand, if you quit because of workplace abuse, be sure to raise the issue with your boss. Unless you have a very serious problem, don't blame other co-workers for your departure.</p>
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            <h2>Donâ€™t talk about your new job</h2>
                            <p>If your boss asks you about your next venture or direction, don't give too much information. To avoid possible problems with your new job, you are welcome to mention the industry you work in, but please do not mention the name of your future company.</p>
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            <h2>Create detailed hand-over documents</h2>
                            <p>List all projects you have worked on, along with the names and phone numbers of clients, employees, and other stakeholders. Create process diagrams for each project and add all relevant data such as email correspondence and other documents. Companies often hire other people to do your work, so write for people who have never worked on the same project before. The material should be as comprehensive and well organized as possible.</p>
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            <h2>Return all company belongings</h2>
                            <p>Be sure to return all company-owned or leased equipment before departure, including laptops, keys, cell phones, flash drives, and other items. Also, please return your health insurance card. Don't forget your name! A stack of business cards collected in the course of work is considered property of the company and will be very useful in the future.</p>
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            <h2>Prepare small gifts</h2>
                            <p>Thank you to everyone at the company, or at least the people you worked with personally. Sweets, small gifts like mugs and tea sets, thank you notes, everyone will appreciate it. Prepare these for your last day at work. Most Japanese companies say goodbye with a small party and a bouquet of flowers, so giving something back always makes a positive impression. please</p>
