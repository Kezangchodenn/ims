                        Managing a safe and healthy workplace for your florist business
                        should be front of mind during peak season trading, as well as 
                        slower times of the year. Keeping up to date with things like 
                        workplace risks and safety is not only something you should like
                        to do but it is also required by Australian law. Floristry is 
                        certainly not a risky business, but if things go wrong, it puts
                        your reputation and livelihood at stake
                      </p>
                      <br>
                      <br>
                      <p>
                        To get you started, we have prepared a list of some key safety 
                        points that you should run through and see how they apply to your
                        business. Remember, your business constantly changes as do many
                        rules and laws, so you need to review these policies at least 
                        once a year.
